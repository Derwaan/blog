title: My note-taking experiment - Part 1
---

During my studies, I kept looking a the *perfect* note-taking method.
I have tried a lot of them (mind-maps, Cornell, flash-card, ...) but never have I been convinced by one of them.

Now that I have left University (at least for now?), I have this urge to take notes on everything but whitout the correct framework.

Let me explain.
At University, the framework was simple: take notes during the lectures, study those notes, and succeed at the exams (the last step might depends from time to time).
But now that the University time is over, I find myself with a bunch of notes that I don't know how to organize.
I take notes during meetings, I take notes when I am facing a difficult challenge at work, I take notes when I have an amazing idea for a start-up, I take notes of interesting books, etc...

I have those notes that if I don't do anything with them, they will never be used (bye start-up idea worth millions of dollars).

So, I have decided to put myself into a small experiment in order to find the perfect note-taking workflow.

> **tl;dr** My note-taking system has three steps (1. Capture ideas into a notebook; 2. Review et categorize those notes; 3. Create something from those notes). I will write more posts that will describe my follow-ups on this experiment.

# An experimental system

![Habit of taking notes]({{site.baseurl_root}}/images/habit-of-taking-notes.jpg)

This note-taking system is divided into three steps.

1. First, capture the ideas (into a notebook or with Notability)
2. Second, review those notes in order to better understand them and filter out the bad ones
3. Finally, create something from those notes. Without this last step, all this process is irrelevant.

## 1a. Taking notes in a notebook

I have been using a Bullet Journal for the last months.
I write down in this notebook *almost* everything: ideas, meetings, tasks, ...
I also keep track of interesting chat I had during the day.
After the work, I log every piece of information that might be useful for later.
My goal with this journal is not to have something beautiful to show on Instagram.
No, this journal is full of notes that only make sense for me.
But at least, I know that everything I need is in this notebook.
No need to trust my brain and its memory to remember what was said during the meeting or what was the start-up idea I had this morning.

Sometimes, when I want to go deeper with an idea, I take a full page in my notebook to draw, write a mind-map or any other way that helps me.

## 1b. Using Notability

When I am reading a book, I directly take notes in it (if I have it physically) or I create highlights with my Kindle.
Doing this, helps me be focus on the reading.
Once the book is finished, I create a summary with the main ideas.
I don't just transcribe them verbatim.
I write them with my own words in order for me to better grasp the notions behind the book.

Those notes, I could just use my Bullet Journal to take them.
But I prefer using Notability on my iPad.
It allows me to store those notes more easily and it prevents my Bullet Journal of running out of pages quickly.

## 2. Review my notes

Ok, so I takes notes in my journal (or with Notability) and that's good.
Taking notes of everything allows the mind to be free and focus on our work.
But with all these ideas put together, how to find (or retrieve) the best ones?
The ones that will allow me to build the best start-up in the world?

After one week or two, I get back to my notes and review them.
This delay allows me to forget about my notes and rediscover what I have written.
At this moment, I can decide if this idea is worthless (that occurs a lot with me) or if this note is important for me.
If the though is important, I extract it from my notebook (or Notability) and write it down on a piece of paper.
This piece of paper is then stored and categorized to be found later when needed.

This place where all the best ideas are stored is my **commonplace book**.
In my case, I use an Atoma notebook with detachable sheets.

## 3. Create something from my notes

Here we are.
My notes are securely stored and categorized and I can find them back whenever I want.
But even with this all process, this is worthless if I don't create something.

With my commonplace book, I can retrieve my notes and build something with them.
That could be an article like this one or a start-up that will change the world, everything starts with a note.
Applying what we learn allows us to remember more.
Creating and sharing your work with others might be the best way to learn.

# Final words

I will start to apply this system (already did with this article) that I will document with follow-up articles.
I think this can be useful for people that, like me, look for the perfect note-taking system.
